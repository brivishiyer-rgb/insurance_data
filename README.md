# insurance_data_sql_project

The objective of this project is to perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset using a variety of SQL clauses and aggregate functions. The analysis will focus on understanding the distribution of data and the key factors influencing insurance charges.

The project will use the following SQL components to achieve its goals:

CREATE TABLE: To define the schema for the insurance data.

SELECT and FROM: To specify the columns and source table for each query.

WHERE: To filter the data based on specific conditions, such as charges, BMI, or smoker status.

GROUP BY: To group rows that have the same values in specified columns, enabling aggregate analysis by categories like sex, age group, or region.

AVG() and COUNT(): To calculate key metrics like the average charges, average BMI, or the number of people in each group.

CASE: To create custom, categorical age groups for more meaningful analysis.

ORDER BY and LIMIT: To sort the results (e.g., by charges) and retrieve only a specific number of records.

ROUND(): To format numerical results for better readability.

By leveraging these SQL clauses, the project aims to extract, summarize, and present crucial insights from the raw data, providing a clear foundation for further analysis.
